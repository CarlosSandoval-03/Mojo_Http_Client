> [!NOTE]
> Possibly the project dies before even achieving the first task.
>
> This terrible task was imposed by one of the CEOs of BetterCampus :(

> [!NOTE]
> If you have any ideas for the name of the project, it is welcome.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a miracle happens and the goal is achieved, you will not be given any future support, please note that Mojo is still in development and this, under the theory that it works, can stop working at any time
>
> Do not trust me :)
>
> But you can fork the project and continue it if you like.
